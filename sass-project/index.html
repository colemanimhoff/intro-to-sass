        <p>Yea and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mothers ovaries! I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please. high chair, no no no recliner... and wheelchair on half. Aw, c'mon Rick. That doesn't seem so bad. Oh I say good sir, oh harumph, ohh a bope-a-dope-o-bobo.</p>
        <p>I love morty and i hope morty loves me. I want to wrap my arms around him and feel him deep inside me. Whoa, spoilers! I'm a whole season behind. We need a hang glider, and a crotch less uncle sam costume, and I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked red heads, and I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father. Me irresponsible? All I wanted was for you to hand me a screwdriver! But instead you had me buckle down and make you a roofie juice serum, so you can roofie that poor girl at your school. W-w-w-w--are you kidding me, Morty?! You're really gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y'know your-you're a little creep, Morty! Your-your-your-you're just a little creepy creep person!</p>
        <p>Existence is pain to a meeseeks Jerry, and we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Cool. Just stay in the driveway; the kill-bots are live, and I took you off the whitelist. Lick, lick, lick my balls! We don't whitewash it either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey.</p>

        <p>Ohh yea, you gotta get schwifty. Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghost trains. It's not all bad though, they were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle. I wanna be alive, I am alive! Alive i tell you. Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I wanna hold you. I wanna run in a stream. I wanna taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it! Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiiiveeeeee… Hello. If you break the rules, try to leave or lose the game, you will die. Just like Saaaaw.</p>
        <p>Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash! Thanks Noob Noob, this guy gets it. Like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? You know what those guys do in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls and dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other. You know Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public because grandpa isn't shady. Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes!</p>
        <p>Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood. Please god, oh lord, hear my prayers…! YES! Fuck you god, not today bitch! Rikitikitavi, bitch! I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to, grab him and, stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?!</p>
