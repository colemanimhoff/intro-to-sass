SASS is already installed in this project and styles have been added. Review the syntax and feel free to add your own styles!

To get started...

    Go to your terminal and enter the following commands:

        1. `npm run build:sass`
        2. `npm run build:sass:watch`

    Add your styles in the input.sass file...SASS syntax is being used for this project, but feel free to sart over with SCSS styax!

    After you save your changes, look at the tab in your terminal where you are running the `watch` command. You will see successful compiling in green and unsucessful compiling in red (this usually is a result of a syntax error or undefined variable)

    Open a new tab and run lite-server or http-server to see your changes!

Make sure that you have a SASS or SCSS package installed in your text editor to help with syntax highlighting!
